### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science graduate from San Diego State University, currently diving deep into embedded software engineering.

ðŸ“š I'm currently building my skills in Python, C, C++, and working on hands-on projects with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

ðŸ”§ Iâ€™m focused on developing embedded systems and practical solutions, and I'm working towards securing a role where I can apply these skills in real-world applications.

ðŸŽµ In my free time, I enjoy making music and exploring new tech projects.
